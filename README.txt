1) Replace your script reference to use script.v026f.js:
   <script src="script.v026f.js" defer></script>

2) (Optional) To hide the slider/checkbox entirely, include this after your main styles:
   <link rel="stylesheet" href="hide-overlay-controls.css">

Notes:
- Overlay always renders ON TOP with opacity 1.
- Default overlay is auto-loaded from assets/letter_poker_v2_fixed.svg if present.
- You can still use the file chooser to replace the overlay at any time.
